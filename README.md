# ragno [r√†-gno] Eng. Spider
 
Ragno is a tool that aggregates IOC from VirusTotal and lets you expand your IOC list for any Malware Campaign that you are responding to. You can use as little as one single IP to expand and get an entire list of IOC for the full campaign within a few seconds. 
A Malware campaign usually has a few different executables that have a number of C2 IPs/Domains that they reach out to. By using Ragno, you can expand on one of those C2 IOC and get the entire campaign's C2 info or very close to it. The idea is to get as many related files or network information related to those malicious files as possible.
